### Documenting and coding based on Medical Decision Making (MDM)

Evaluation and Management (E/M) codes are a category of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes used by healthcare providers to document and bill for patient encounters. These codes describe the complexity and nature of patient visits, whether in an outpatient or inpatient setting. Key components for determining the appropriate E/M code include:

History: The level of detail in the patient‚Äôs medical history taken during the visit.
Examination: The thoroughness of the physical exam performed.

Medical Decision Making (MDM): The complexity of establishing diagnoses, assessing conditions, and selecting treatment plans.
These components help in determining the appropriate level of service to be billed, ensuring proper documentation and maximizing reimbursement [1].

<response>
**Medical Decision Making (MDM)** is a critical component used in coding for Evaluation and Management (E/M) services. It involves assessing the complexity of medical decisions required during a patient visit and is one of the key factors in determining the appropriate E/M code for billing purposes. MDM is evaluated based on:

1. **Number and Complexity of Problems Addressed**: The range and seriousness of medical issues discussed during the visit.
2. **Amount and/or Complexity of Data to be Reviewed and Analyzed**: The volume and difficulty of medical records, test results, and other data that the provider reviews.
3. **Risk of Complications and/or Morbidity or Mortality of Patient Management Decisions**: The potential risks associated with the patient's treatment decisions and management.

These components help in assessing the level of service provided, which influences the coding and billing for the visit [[1](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/fpm/issues/2022/0100/p26.html)][[2](https://www.aafp.org/family-physician/practice-and-career/getting-paid/coding/evaluation-management.html)][[3](https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/practice-management/coding-and-reimbursement/update-on-2021-office-outpatient-e-m-billing-and-d)][[4](https://www.facs.org/for-medical-professionals/practice-management/coding-and-billing/em-coding-billing/officeoutpatient-em-visit-coding-changes/medical-decision-making/)].
