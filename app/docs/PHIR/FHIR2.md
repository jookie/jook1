# [RAG on FHIR with Knowledge Graphs](https://chatgpt.com/c/18d9875e-e920-46bb-a349-4e5fc899a33c)

In this article, Dov Peles builds upon his previous discussion on using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Fast Healthcare Interoperable Resources (FHIR) by addressing two critical aspects often overlooked: the interconnected nature of healthcare data and the importance of time in healthcare queries.

## Healthcare Data Connectivity

FHIR recognizes that healthcare data is inherently linked. For example, a blood pressure reading is associated not only with the patient but also with the specific encounter during which it was taken, the time of the reading, and the healthcare provider. These connections are crucial for understanding a patient's health comprehensively. For instance, to evaluate the effectiveness of a treatment, one must trace the links from the initial diagnosis through subsequent treatments and follow-up readings.

## The Importance of Time

To determine the success of a treatment, it's essential to consider the timing of the intervention and subsequent health measurements. Although FHIR resources include dates, they are not inherently ordered. Therefore, sorting data by date is necessary to assess whether a patient's condition improved following a specific treatment.

## Enhancing RAG with Knowledge Graphs

While RAG utilizes a Vector Index to capture the semantic meaning of FHIR resources for efficient search and retrieval, it doesn't account for the inherent links between resources. To address this, Schifman introduces Knowledge Graphs, which store nodes (data points) and edges (connections between data points). Knowledge Graphs can represent complex healthcare data relationships, allowing for more nuanced queries.

### Constructing Knowledge Graphs from FHIR

Schifman demonstrates how to transform FHIR data into a Knowledge Graph by creating nodes for each FHIR resource and edges based on references within these resources. This graph structure allows for a detailed representation of a patient's healthcare journey, linking various data points such as encounters, medications, and lab results.

### Integrating Time into Knowledge Graphs

To incorporate the concept of time, unique nodes representing dates are created and linked to relevant data points. This structure enables queries that consider both the semantic content and the temporal context of the data.

## Answering Complex Questions

With the enhanced data structure, Schifman illustrates how to answer complex healthcare questions. For example, to find the cost of a colon scan on a specific date, the system can locate relevant nodes using vector search and then refine the results based on the specified date. This approach combines the strengths of vector search and the detailed relational context provided by Knowledge Graphs.

## Conclusion

By integrating Knowledge Graphs with FHIR data and considering the temporal dimension, Schifman's approach enhances the capabilities of RAG in healthcare. This method supports more accurate and contextually relevant responses to complex queries, ultimately aiding healthcare providers in making informed decisions.
